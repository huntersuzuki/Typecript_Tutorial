This TypeScript code demonstrates the use of special types like `null` and `undefined`. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **1. Assigning `null` to a Variable**
```typescript
let data: null;
data = null;
```
- Here, `data` is explicitly declared with the type `null`, meaning it **can only hold `null` values**.
- If we try to assign anything else, like a string (`data = "hii";`), TypeScript will throw an error:  
  **"Type '"hii"' is not assignable to type 'null'."**
- This is useful when we want to ensure that `data` can only have a `null` value and nothing else.

---

### **2. Using a Union Type with `null`**
```typescript
let user: null | string;
```
- This means `user` can hold either a `null` value or a `string`.
- The `|` (pipe) operator is used to create a **union type**, allowing multiple possible types.
- Examples of valid assignments:
  ```typescript
  user = "max";  // Allowed because it's a string
  user = null;   // Allowed because null is part of the union type
  ```
- This is useful in cases where a variable might **optionally** hold data (e.g., when a user logs out, their username can be set to `null`).

---

### **3. Special Type: `undefined`**
Similar to `null`, TypeScript also has the `undefined` type.

```typescript
let value: undefined;
value = undefined;
```
- The variable `value` can only store `undefined`, and assigning anything else will result in an error.
- `undefined` means that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  let something: undefined | number;
  something = 42;        // Allowed
  something = undefined; // Allowed
  ```
- This is useful when a value might not be initialized yet but will be assigned later.

### **Difference Between `null` and `undefined`**
| Feature        | `null`                                         | `undefined`                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Meaning        | Represents an intentional absence of value     | Represents an uninitialized value                            |
| Default Value? | No, you must assign `null` explicitly          | Yes, variables are `undefined` by default if not initialized |
| Type           | Primitive type                                 | Primitive type                                               |
| Use Case       | Used when you want to explicitly clear a value | Used when a variable is not assigned a value                 |

### **Why Use `null | type` or `undefined | type`?**
- Helps in writing safer code.
- Avoids unexpected `undefined` errors.
- Useful in APIs where some data may be `null` (e.g., fetching user info but the user is not found).
