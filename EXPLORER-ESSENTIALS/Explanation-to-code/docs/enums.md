# Enums in TypeScript

Enums are a feature in TypeScript that allow you to define a set of named constants. They are a way to give more friendly names to sets of numeric values, making your code more readable and maintainable.

## What is an Enum?

An enum (short for "enumeration") is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables). Enums can be numeric or string-based.

### Numeric Enums

In TypeScript, numeric enums are the most common type. By default, enums begin numbering their members starting at 0. For example:

```typescript
enum Role {
  Admin,  // 0
  Editor, // 1
  Guest   // 2
}
```

In this example, the `Role` enum has three members: `Admin`, `Editor`, and `Guest`. The values assigned to these members are 0, 1, and 2, respectively.

### Using Enums

You can use enums to create variables that can only take on one of the predefined values. For example:

```typescript
let userRole: Role = Role.Admin;
userRole = Role.Guest; // Valid
userRole = Role.Editor; // Valid
```

This ensures that `userRole` can only be assigned one of the values defined in the `Role` enum.

### Benefits of Using Enums

1. **Readability**: Enums provide meaningful names to sets of numeric values, making the code easier to understand.
2. **Maintainability**: If you need to change the underlying values, you can do so in one place without affecting the rest of your code.
3. **Type Safety**: Enums help catch errors at compile time by restricting the values that can be assigned to a variable.

### Conclusion

Enums are a powerful feature in TypeScript that enhance code clarity and maintainability. By using enums, developers can create more robust applications with clear and defined sets of values.
